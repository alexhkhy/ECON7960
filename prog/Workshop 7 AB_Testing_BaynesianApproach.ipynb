    "5.  Do you know what the parameter $\\alpha$ might be? No. At this point, you could continue and assign a distribution to $\\alpha$, but it's better to stop once you reach a set level of ignorance: whereas you have a prior belief about $\\lambda$, (\"it probably changes over time\", \"it's likely between 10 and 30\", etc.), you don't really have any strong beliefs about $\\alpha$. So it's best to stop here. \n",

You think that the $\\lambda$s are between 10-30, so if we set $\\alpha$ really low (which corresponds to larger probability on high values) we are not reflecting your prior well. Similar, a too-high alpha misses your prior belief as well. A good idea for $\\alpha$ as to reflect your belief is to set the value so that the mean of $\\lambda$, given $\\alpha$, is equal to your observed mean. \n",
